        I have learned flex boxes. The first step in using flexbox is to turn one of our HTML elements into a 
        flex container. We do this with the display property, which should be familiar from the CSS Box Model 
        chapter. By giving it a value of flex, we’re telling the browser that everything in the box should be 
        rendered with flexbox instead of the default box model. When we describe flexbox as being one 
        dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — 
        either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid 
        Layout, which controls columns and rows together.

        I have learned a simple webpage with just pragraphs titles and pictures. What is an example of a HTML
         page? HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language which is defined as the coding used to include 
         color, language, and graphics on a webpage. An example of HTML is the set of codes a person uses to 
         make a blue webpage with yellow fonts.

        I also learned HTML forms. An HTML form is a section of a document which contains controls such as 
        text fields, password fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit button, menus etc. An HTML form 
        facilitates the user to enter data that is to be sent to the server for processing such as name, email 
        address, password, phone number, etc. . In HTML Language, we can create different kind of forms using 
        various input fields. Most commonly used form elements are Text, Password, Number, Radio, Checkboxes, 
        Textarea, Dropdown, Calendar (Date), URL, Upload file, Submit, Reset, and many more. In this HTML 
        Contact Form template, we have included all these fields.

        I learned animations. To create animation on page load, we just need to use @keyframes and some 
        animation properties. Let's start with HTML. Use a tag and place elements inside. Add @keyframes with 
        the name "slideInLeft" and use 0% and 100% as a starting point and ending point of the animation, 
        respectively. Animated images in HTML are an image on a web page that moves. It is in GIF format i.e. 
        Graphics Interchange Format file. We need to use the tag with the src attribute to add an animated 
        image in HTML. The src attribute adds the URL of the image (file destination).

        I learned how to upload a webpage on GitHub. GitHub has a detailed help document on how to set up and 
        use Git if you are interested. To upload your website’s files to the repository, click on the uploading
         an existing file link shown below, or add /upload to the page’s URL and head over to that page (i.e ).
         Make a new, empty GitHub repository and fill out some information about your repository (make sure you
        are logged in to GitHub or made a GitHub account already!) Once you have created the repository, 
        click "uploading an existing file" Drag & drop your HTML & CSS files or choose your HTML/CSS files 
        manually.
        </p>
